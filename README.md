# Neural-Network-Basics

Not 100% my code, this is a learning project I did two years ago, to learn the basic of nural networks. Inside you can see implementation of a simple nural network with only vanilla python and numpy. There are diffrent types of layers, acctivation functions, loss functions and optimaizers.

Most of the things learned from the NNFS book: https://nnfs.io.
